# Aptitude-test-portal
This is my ASEP project where I have built an aptitude test website using html ,css, javascript for frontend and node.js and express.js for backend along with mysql for database 
<br>
The Aptitude Test Builder Website is a smart, web-based platform designed to simulate real exam environments with advanced features like customizable topic-wise tests, AI-powered proctoring, and detailed performance analysis. Users can select topics such as Time & Distance or Profit & Loss, choose the number of questions and test duration, and take a timed test while the system monitors their behavior using full-screen mode, tab switch detection, and webcam input (optional). After submission, the platform generates an in-depth report showing accuracy, time spent per question, strong and weak areas, and improvement tips. Built with a clean, responsive UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React and Tailwind), the platform also includes accessibility features and adheres to data privacy standards like GDPR. This project serves as a professional-grade solution for students, educators, and institutions aiming to assess aptitude skills fairly and efficiently.
(Also for the proctoring purpose i had used the auto proctor api which has expired now)
